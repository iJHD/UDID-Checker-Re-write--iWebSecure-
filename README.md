==================================
Short Description:
The new UDID Checker that prevents un-authorized access to your Premium Goodies.

==================================
FAQ:
 1. What/s the use?
  The use of this simple open-sourced PHP script is to prevent unauthorized users from accesing your
premium/VIP page which contained important files that is only exclusive for authorized users.

 2. Will it be easy for the users from using this script?
  For the meantime, I rate this project 75% user friendly because its still at the BETA stage.

 3. Will it be easy for us Webmaster/s or Administrator/s from using this script?
  Same with the users. Since the Admin Panel is still at the early stage, it will still have less features
and more bugs to clean up.

 4. Since this project is v1.0.0b2, is it working properly now?
  Yes the core pretty works however the new added feature is still at the development stage which will make
you easy to use this script.
